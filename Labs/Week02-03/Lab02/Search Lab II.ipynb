    "## OVERVIEW\n",
    "We exercise adverserial search in terms of the game tic-tac-toe, a very simple game but complex enough to help us practice what we learned in the lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "We implement minimax search, alpha-beta search, and ... to help our player play tic-tac-toe and a connect-four variant of tic-tac-toe. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with defining the abstract class `Game`, for turn-taking *n*-player games. A game is similar to a problem, but it has a terminal test instead of a goal test, and a utility for each terminal state. To create a game, subclass `Game` and implement `actions`, `result`, `is_terminal`, and `utility`. You will also need to set the `.initial` attribute to the initial state; this can be done in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We rely on, but do not define yet, the concept of a `state` of the game; we'll see later how individual games define states. For now, all we require is that a state has a `state.to_move` attribute, which gives the name of the player whose turn it is. (\"Name\" will be something like `'X'` or `'O'` for tic-tac-toe.) \n",
    "\n",
    "We also define `play_game`, which takes a game and a dictionary of  `{player_name: strategy_function}` pairs, and plays out the game, on each turn checking `state.to_move` to see whose turn it is, and then getting the strategy function for that player and applying it to the game and the state to get a move."

    "# Tic-Tac-Toe and Board\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the notion of an abstract game, based on it, we define a real game; a simple one, `TicTacToe`. Moves are `(x, y)` pairs denoting squares, where `(0, 0)` is the top left, and `(2, 2)` is the bottom right (on a board of size `height=width=3`). You need `k` squares in a row to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "States in tic-tac-toe (and other games) will be represented as a `Board`, which is a subclass of `defaultdict` that in general will consist of `{(x, y): contents}` pairs, for example `{(0, 0): 'X', (1, 1): 'O'}` might be the state of the board after two moves. Besides the contents of squares, a board also has some attributes: \n",
    "- `.to_move` to name the player whose move it is ('X' plays first against 'O'); \n",
    "- `.width` and `.height` to give the size of the board (both 3 in tic-tac-toe, but other numbers in related games);\n",
    "- possibly other attributes, as specified by keywords. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `Board` has the player to move, a cached utility value, and a dict of `{(x, y): player}` entries, where player is `X` or `O`. As a `defaultdict`, the `Board` class has a `__missing__` method, which returns `empty` for squares that have no been assigned but are within the `width` Ã— `height` boundaries, or `off` otherwise. The class has a `__hash__` method, so instances can be stored in hash tables."
