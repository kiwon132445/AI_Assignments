    "## Model  Design\n",
    "Now that the training data is worked out, we need to design a proper neural network architecture based on our learning objective. This process is the same in pretty much every single new task. If you remember, earlier we mentioned that the letters are appearing one after another in the names and we want to train a network that can learn the probability of each letter given the previous letter (that have already been generated). As you know, the dependence of each letter to the letters that have appeared before itself can be modelled using a recurrent neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can either go ahead and use the off-the-shelf designed RNNs (e.g. [`torch.nn.GRU`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GRU.html) and [`torch.nn.LSTM`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html)), or in our case, we can design a new recurrent neural network architecture. We mainly do this to learn how to make a new neural network architecture ([`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html)), but it also is good because our task doesn't need lots of complexities with which the off-the-shelf designed RNNs are packaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will implement your first torch `Module`, but since you are new to the task, the design has already been provided to you and you will simply look at the network graph and try to implement it. Here is the designed network architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"720\" src=\"Model.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this architecture follow this step-by-step guidelines:\n",
    "1. Create a class and name it `RNN`.\n",
    "2. Make the class inherit from `torch.nn.Module`. This way your class is automatically considered as a torch module and can be saved, loaded, and passed to loss calculators for auto-grad calculation.\n",
    "    - In addition to `__init__` function, add two other functions to your class; `forward` and `initHidden`. The following points will explain how you will implement each function.\n",
    "3. The `__init__` function is where you initialize all the components of the module. \n",
    "    - The inputs to this function would be the input, hidden layer and output sizes\n",
    "    - First function call would be to the `__init__` function of the supercalss (`torch.nn.Module`)\n",
    "    - Next, create the three `nn.Linear` modules as depicted in the graph design. The connections of these modules will be implemented in the `forward` function.\n",
    "    - The output size of `m1` will be of `output_size`.\n",
    "    - The output size of `m2` will be of `hidden_size`.\n",
    "    - The output size of `m3` will be of `output_size`.\n",
    "    - Also, create an instance of [`torch.nn.LogSoftmax`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LogSoftmax.html) with `dim=-1`.\n",
    "4. The `initHidden` function will always return a `zeros` vector of size (`1` $\\times$ `hidden_size`). **Make sure you call `.to(device)` on the created tensor**.\n",
    "5. The `forward` function is the most important function which is inherited from `torch.nn.Module`. This function is automatically called when an input is passed to the module instance and it atomatically updates the gradient values in the computation graph unless `with torch.no_grad():` is in effect. In this function, you describe how your input ``(language, current letter in name, hidden state)`` is converted to the expected output  ``(next letter in name, next hidden state)``, and the only tools you have at your disposal are the modules instantiated in `__init__` function.\n",
    "    - Take `language`, `current_letter`, and `hidden_vector` as input to this function. The initial value of `hidden_vector` will be provided from `initHidden` function.\n",
    "    - As stated in the diagram, using [`torch.cat`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cat.html), concatenate all the input tensors and pass them to the linear modules `m1` and `m2` producing the outputs `mo1` and `mo2`. Concatenate `mo1` and `mo2` and pass it through the third linear module `m3` and pass its result through the log_softmax instance to get `res`. Return `mo1` as the next hidden state and return `res` as the produced output."
