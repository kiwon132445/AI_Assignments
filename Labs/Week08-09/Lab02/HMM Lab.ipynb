    "## OVERVIEW\n",
    "We didn't have enough time to cover all the material in Chapter 14 (Probabilistic Reasoning over Time). One important part of that chapter is section 14.3 which discusses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we learn what HMMs are and try a relatively simple and easy application of them in behaviour prediction. Due to time considrations, we will not implement the HMM model but rather use a proper implementation of it in `hmmlearn` library. The content and ideas of this lab are from [A story of the morning insanity](https://zerowithdot.com/hidden-markov-model-morning-insanity/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## So what's the story?\n",
    "\n",
    "Picture the following scenario: It's at 7 a.m. You're preparing to go to work. In practice, it means that you are running like crazy between different rooms. You spend some random amount of time in each, doing something, hoping to get everything you need to be sorted before you leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make things worse**, your girlfriend (or boyfriend) has *cats*. The little furball wants to eat. Due to the morning hustle, it is uncertain whether you would remember to feed it. If you don't, the cats will be upset, and so will your girlfriend if she finds out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say your flat has four **rooms**. That is to include the *kitchen*, *bathroom*, *living room* and *bedroom*. You spend some random amount of time in each, and transition between the rooms with a certain probability. At the same time, where ever you go, you are likely to make some distinct kinds of **noises**. Your girlfriend hears these noises and, despite being still asleep, she can infer in which room you are spending your time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so she does that day by day. She wants to make sure that you do feed the cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since she can't be there, all she can do is to place the cat food bag in a room where you supposedly **stay the longest**. Hopefully, that will increase the chances that you do feed the \"beast\" (and save your evening).\n"
